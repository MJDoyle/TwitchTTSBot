Simple bot for text-to-speech via twitch channel rewards

Solution for Visual Studio 2019

############ SETUP

An account for the bot must be registered at https://www.twitch.tv/

Then generate an OAUTH code at https://twitchapps.com/tmi/

config.txt must contain the bot OAUTH code on the first line, and the namw of the twitch channel to join on the second line

A channel point reward should be set up on the twitch channel, which allows the redeemer to enter a message. This message will then be spoken by the bot when the reward is redeemed.
